### Colors

- `catppuccin-mocha` based

I tried to adhear to the catppuccin color scheme, but I have deviated from it in some places.

### Tailwind CSS

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. You can find quite a few custom theme variables in `src/styles/global.css`.

### MDX Components

We use MDX for writing our blog posts. You can find the custom components in `src/components/mdx`.

### Aesthetics

I personally hate rounded corners, so I used very low `border-radius` values.
