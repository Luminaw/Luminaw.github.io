# Luminaw Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Luminaw project. Luminaw is a personal portfolio and blog theme built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and a focus on visual excellence without the use of gradients.

## Core Principles

- **Dark Purple Aesthetic**: Inspired by Catppuccin Mocha.
- **Minimal Rounding**: Sleek 4px corners.
- **Visual Depth**: Layering and blobs over gradients.
- **Performance First**: Optimized for speed and accessibility.
