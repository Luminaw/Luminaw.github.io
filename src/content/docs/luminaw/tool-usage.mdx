# Tool Usage

Learn how to use the various tools included in this project. Luminaw uses a variety of modern web technologies to provide a high-quality developer experience.

## Styling with Tailwind

We use Tailwind 4 for styling. You can find the custom theme variables in `src/styles/global.css`.

### Custom Colors
Our palette includes:
- `mauve`: The primary accent color.
- `base`: The main background.
- `surface0`: Used for borders and cards.

## MDX Components

You can use custom components in your MDX files. For example, the `Callout` component:

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
  Use the `mauve` text color for emphasizing important keywords in your docs.
</Callout>
