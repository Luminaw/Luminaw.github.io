import Callout from "../../components/mdx/Callout.astro";

I made a quick day project today, it's called spell_check.

### What is Spell Check?

Spell Check is a command-line tool that checks for spelling errors in your code.

### Why did I make it?

I made it because I wanted to have a tool that could check for spelling errors in this very site! and I wanted a tool that could help me catch them.

### How does it work?

It uses a dictionary of words to check for spelling errors in your code.

### How do I use it?

You can use it by running `spell_check check` in your terminal.

It also has a nice [config](/docs/spell_check/configuration).

### Want more info?

You can find more info on the [docs](/docs/spell_check).

### Where can I find it?

You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/luminaw/spell_check).

### Next steps

I will be adding it to this site to check for spelling errors in my blog posts.

I also might add some benchmarking on it for speed to see how to optimize it more later.
