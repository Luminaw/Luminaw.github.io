### Why I made this blog

I made this blog to share my thoughts, ideas, some tutorials, and overall just to get better at technical writing.

### About this blog

This blog is made with Astro and Tailwind CSS. I also decided on using MDX for writing my blog posts. I'm not a big fan of writing blog posts, but I think it's a good way to share my knowledge with the world.

#### Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.io/)
- [Sitemap](https://astro.build/integrations/astro-sitemap/)

#### A few cool features

- Bullet points are nice

```ts
const x = 1; // code blocks are nice
```

```rust title="main.rs" {3} {"words"}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    // especially when I can highlight things too
    // even specific words
}
```

- bullet points are nice
    - nested bullet points make it even better
        - especially when they line up

1. Numbered lists are nice
    1. When we can organize them more
        1. And even more than that!

- [ ] We can even make a todo list.
- [x] And sometimes we get it done!

> Blockquotes are nice too. - someone

I can even ~~cross~~ things out.

Or bold **this**.

links look pretty too [like this](https://astro.build/).

Or I can even send you to another page with a [link](/blog/).

Or just to another heading on this page with a [link](#about-this-blog).

The other cool thing I can do is embed code into my blog posts, like this:

<div class="p-6 border rounded-xl bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-900 flex flex-col items-center gap-4 my-4">
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <span class="text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-widest text-zinc-500">Counter</span>
    <span id="counter" class="text-5xl font-bold font-mono tabular-nums">0</span>
  </div>
  <div class="flex gap-2">
    <button 
      class="px-4 py-2 bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800 rounded-lg hover:bg-zinc-300 dark:hover:bg-zinc-700 transition-colors"
      onclick="document.getElementById('counter').textContent--"
    >
      Decrement
    </button>
    <button 
      class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors shadow-md shadow-blue-500/20"
      onclick="document.getElementById('counter').textContent++"
    >
      Increment
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

or even animate something:

<div class="p-6 border rounded-xl bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-900 flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-8 my-4 h-64">
  <div 
    class="w-16 h-16 bg-blue-600 rounded-full cursor-pointer shadow-xl shadow-blue-500/20"
    onclick="this.animate([
      { transform: 'translateY(0) scale(1)' },
      { transform: 'translateY(80px) scale(1.2, 0.8)', offset: 0.5 },
      { transform: 'translateY(0) scale(1)' }
    ], {
      duration: 600,
      easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)'
    })"
  ></div>
  <span class="text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-widest text-zinc-500">Click the ball to bounce</span>
</div>

or even make a component:

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
  Use the `mauve` text color for emphasizing important keywords in your docs.
</Callout>


### What to expect

I'll be posing more about projects I am working on, tutorials, and overall just get better at technical writing skills. I give no promises on the frequency of posts, but I'll try my best to keep it up to date.
